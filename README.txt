This app was built using ReactJs
 - For managing state I used React Hooks
 - For HTTP requests I used Axios library
 - React-router-dom was used for navigating through the app
 - React-star-rating was used for rendering the course rating and improving visuals
 - The styling was done with Css modules

On the main page a user can view all the courses, he can search a course by title and filter them by level. Clicking on a course will redirect the user to a page with more details.

Running the app: 

- npm install
- npm start
